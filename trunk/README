This is an Interactive Prototype made for demonstrating and testing, so many of the functions do not actually work. Here are the limitations:

Login Screen:
- "Create account" button does not work
- Any log in will work

Timer:
- Stats from the game timer are not actually incorporated in the "Stats" tab

General:
- "Opponents" and "Rules" tabs unimplemented
- All groups, opponents, and stats are pre-made
