BETTERBET is a poker analyzing application that helps users keep track of their statistics and opponents.
Some features are:
- Live Game Timer (keep track of time and rounds won)
- Rules (for learning about different types of poker games)
- Opponents (keeping track of the people you play with and their strategies)
- Stats (to keep track of your own statistics)

This is an Interactive Prototype made for demonstrating and testing, so many of the functions do not actually work. Here are the limitations:

Login Screen:
- "Create account" button does not work
- Any log in will work

Timer:
- Stats from the game timer are not actually incorporated in the "Stats" tab

General:
- "Opponents" and "Rules" tabs unimplemented
- All groups, opponents, and stats are pre-made
